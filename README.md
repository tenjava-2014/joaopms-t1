Why did you give up?
--------------------

While being fun at the start, I started to loose my motivation to keep coding this plugin. After some breaks to think about the future of the plugin and coming back to it, I finally lost all of my motivation.
Since I'm not having fun, I decided to stop working on this project. Maybe it's the theme, maybe it's me, I don't really know.
I just want to thank everyone involved on this great project and the opportunity they gave me. Also, good luck to every participant and don't give up like me!
